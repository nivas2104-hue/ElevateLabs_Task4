# Task 4 — Firewall Setup and Test

**OS tested on:** Windows 10 / Ubuntu 22.04 (edit accordingly)  

## Objective
Configure and test firewall rules to block inbound Telnet (port 23) and allow SSH (port 22), then verify functionality.

## Files in this repository
- `commands.txt` — commands executed during the task.
- `screenshots/` — screenshots showing each step:
  - initial rules
  - adding block rule
  - testing block
  - removing block rule

## Steps Performed
1. Listed current firewall rules for documentation.  
2. Added rule to block inbound Telnet (port 23).  
3. Tested the rule locally (and remotely if possible).  
4. Allowed SSH (port 22) to prevent lockout (if on Linux).  
5. Removed test block rule to restore original state.  
6. Captured screenshots and saved commands in `commands.txt`.
